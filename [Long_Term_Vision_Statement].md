# [NAME OF COMPANY]

## Goals:

- Become a viable solution for detecting bots across a wide range of social platforms and messaging channels.
- Promote online resourcefulness, as well as critical thinking in regards to the internet.
- Offer users tools to verify the authenticity of digital media.
- Uphold fairness, privacy, and respect for users.


## Idea Origination:

The reason we chose this topic was because of the considerable decline of internet safety knowledge and simultaneous rise of bot activity online. With monumental developments in generative AI models, they have quickly fallen under the use of bad actors: ranging from innocent photos to falsified speeches given by influential figures, we want to help create a space between human and ingenuine, programmed activity. 

## Purpose/Values/Mission:

Our purpose is to create a digital ecosystem that is once more authentic and trustworthy. We are committed to transparency, integrity, and accountability, in order to acknowledge how powerful modern technology is in influencing the spread of information. Our mission is to fire with fire: develop an algorithm that quickly detects and suppresses bots, but also develop an equally powerful team of people to assist this algorithm. The goal is to make it easier to discern from fiction and reality online where it is increasingly difficult to.

## Key Questions: 

- How can we reduce the amount of false positives after human evaluation?
- How do we comply with online privacy rules?
- How can we stay ahead of evolving technology and strategies used by bad actors?
