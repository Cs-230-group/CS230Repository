## Core Values

We have three main policies about ethics in our business that we follow to make and develop software that is useful to everyone while not breaking any moral code of our employees and clients. 
  To start with, our first policy is “Hinder unwanted invasive actions between clients”. As a social media messaging security company, we do not want any of our users to feel under some sort of threat without the ability to do anything about it. We don’t want anyone to feel a lack of privacy due to the actions of someone they are messaging. We also don’t want to be too nosy into the chats between other people as a company. Hopefully, we will solve this by using some form of AI to report any signs of danger. We will also ask permission before getting involved. Only the person who gave permission will know that we are watching them unless the person wants the other person to know as well. This way no one's personal information will be seen without consent by the company or the other person.
  Our second policy is to “Be useful to the community”. Providing emergency alerts to our users and offering support through text and helplines. This enables us to help our community and provide a positive impact using social media messaging security. We will also hire professionals to be able to offer consulting to anyone who might need it.
  Next, we have “Do not interrupt important or positive communication”. We do not want to cause any harm to the relationships of any family member, friend, or colleague due to our intervention. We hope to only be used in cases such as someone is about to leak private information or cause harm to the individual(s) on the other end.
  To Conclude the core items of our company, we hold these values very close as we believe it is a very important factor to how safe messaging happens online. Every step we make takes into consideration these principles.
