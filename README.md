Entrepeneur and Ethics Project
Game Developer Company or Security System for Messaging 

Week 4 (Thursday, February 8th):
- We decided on Security System for Messaging fo rthe Entrepeneur and Ethics Project
- The reason we chose this topic was because of the lack of understanding of how to stay secure in the recent years and the increasing risk of security and privacy when it comes to messaging and social media
- We will allow our systems to be executed in schools that would like to

- Meeting notes:
- For project 2, what are the goals?,where did your idea come from ( a class, a job, a need)? and what is the purpose, values, and mission?Social media and messaging needs to be more secure.The ideas came for alot of spam account that try to hack your phone or social by just sending you a dm or message.They are offened just generate by computer and is more like a automation.lso were coming up on a new generation of kids who arent as computer fluent so it helps people who arent aware or just learning how to navigate internet safety.Yes we can have the progrsam access to school computers
